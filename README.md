# smart-home

# overview
This is my version of Smart Home application. The Internet of Things system consists of serveral sensor devices, a ESP8266 Wi-Fi module, through which all data is sent to a Firebase server and a mobile application, with which you can control or monitor the work of the entire system. 

# designing
The application was based on the Omaha's Pinter dribbble project.
